# Advanced Web Development - From 0 to 100

## Project Description

I initially created this repository with the goal of adding notes on core web development technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js with Express and EJS. However, as I progressed, I realized that there were additional important topics that should be included to provide a more comprehensive learning experience. These topics include TypeScript, backend engineering fundamentals, software design patterns, and other essential concepts that can help streamline the learning journey.

As a result, I decided to restructure the repository to accommodate these additional notes. I am currently working on expanding the content and organizing it into a more cohesive structure.

Please note that these notes are compiled from various sources, including ChatGPT and other platforms, with the intention of creating a structured learning path. While the content is not entirely original, the goal is to curate and organize it in a way that makes learning more accessible and efficient.
