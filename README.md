# Master Computer Science - From 0 to 100

## Project Description

I initially created this repository with the goal of adding notes on core web development technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js with Express and EJS. However, as I progressed, I realized that there were additional trending technologies that should be included to provide a more comprehensive learning experience. These topics include Machine Learning, Blockchain, and a complete web development curriculum, among others.

As a result, I decided to restructure the repository to accommodate these trending technologies alongside the foundational web development content. I am currently working on expanding the material and organizing it into a more cohesive structure.

Please note that these notes are compiled from various sources, including ChatGPT and other platforms, with the intention of creating a structured learning path. While the content is not entirely original, the goal is to curate and organize it in a way that makes learning more accessible and efficient.
