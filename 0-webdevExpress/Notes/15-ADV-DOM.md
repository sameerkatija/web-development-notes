## Events in JS

In JavaScript, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system or in the user interface that you can respond to programmatically. Events are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, especially when it comes to handling user interactions and creating dynamic, responsive web applications.

### 1. Key Concepts of JavaScript Events

- **Event:** An event is an action that is triggered by user interactions (like clicks, key presses, or mouse movements) or system-generated activities (like page load or form submission).

- **Event Listener:** An event listener is a function that waits for a specific event to occur and then executes a block of code when the event is triggered.

- **Event Target:** The event target is the DOM element that the event is bound to. This is the element that will be affected by the event or where the event occurs.

- **Event Object:** When an event occurs, an event object is automatically created and passed to the event handler. This object contains properties and methods related to the event, such as the type of event, the target element, and additional details (like mouse position for click events).

### 2. Types of Events

#### 2.1 User Interface Events

- `click:` Triggered when an element is clicked.
- `dblclick:` Triggered when an element is double-clicked.
- `mouseover:` Triggered when the mouse pointer is moved over an element.
- `mouseout:` Triggered when the mouse pointer is moved out of an element.
- `focus:` Triggered when an element gains focus (e.g., an input field).
- `blur:` Triggered when an element loses focus.

#### 2.2 Keyboard Events

- `keydown:` Triggered when a key is pressed down.
- `keyup:` Triggered when a key is released.
- `keypress:` Triggered when a key that produces a character value is pressed down.

#### 2.3 Form Events

- `submit:` Triggered when a form is submitted.
- `change:` Triggered when the value of a form element is changed.
- `input:` Triggered when the value of an input field changes.

#### 2.4 Mouse Events

- `mousedown:` Triggered when a mouse button is pressed down.
- `mouseup:` Triggered when a mouse button is released.
- `mousemove:` Triggered when the mouse is moved.

#### 2.5 Window Events

- `load:` Triggered when the window or an element has finished loading.
- `resize:` Triggered when the window is resized.
- `scroll:` Triggered when the document is scrolled.

### 3. Working with Events

#### 3.1 Adding Event Listeners

You can add event listeners to DOM elements using the `addEventListener` method

```js
const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

button.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  alert("Button was clicked!");
});
```

#### 3.2 Event Object Properties

The event object passed to the event handler has various properties, such as:

- `type`: The type of the event (e.g., "click", "keydown").

- `target`: The element that triggered the event.

- `currentTarget`: The element to which the event handler is attached.

- `preventDefault()`: A method that prevents the default action associated with
  the event.

- `stopPropagation()`: A method that stops the event from bubbling up to parent
  elements.

#### 3.3 Removing Event Listeners

You can remove an event listener using the removeEventListener method, but the function passed must be the exact same reference as the one used in addEventListener.

```js
function handleClick(event) {
  alert("Button was clicked!");
}

button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

// Later
button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

By understanding and effectively utilizing events, you can create interactive and responsive web applications that respond to user actions and system changes in real-time.

## Form Events and Prevent Default

Handling form events and preventing default behaviors in JavaScript is essential for creating interactive and user-friendly web forms. By default, forms submit and reload the page, but you often want to handle the form data via JavaScript without causing a full page reload. This is where the `preventDefault()` method comes into play.

### 1. Common Form Events

- `submit`: Triggered when a form is submitted.

- `change`: Triggered when the value of a form element changes.

- `input`: Triggered when the value of an input field changes.

- `focus`: Triggered when an input field gains focus.

- `blur`: Triggered when an input field loses focus.

- `keydown`, `keyup`, `keypress`: Triggered when keys are pressed, released, or
  pressed down on form elements.

### 2. Preventing Default Form Submission

When a form is submitted, it typically sends a request to the server and reloads the page. To handle form submission with JavaScript and prevent the default behavior, you use the `preventDefault()` method within the form’s submit event handler.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Form Submission Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Form Submission</h1>
  <form id="myForm">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
    <br>
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
    <br>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>

  <script>
    const form = document.getElementById('myForm');

    form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
      // Prevent the form from submitting the default way
      event.preventDefault();

      // Access form data
      const formData = new FormData(form);
      const name = formData.get('name');
      const email = formData.get('email');

      // Process the form data (for demonstration, we'll log it)
      console.log('Name:', name);
      console.log('Email:', email);

      // Optionally, you can send data to the server using fetch or XMLHttpRequest
      // Example:
      /*
      fetch('/submit', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
      }).then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => console.log(data));
      */
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Event bubbling

Event bubbling is a fundamental concept in JavaScript's event handling model. It describes the process by which an event propagates from the innermost element that triggered the event (the target) up to the outermost element (the root) in the DOM hierarchy.

### 1. How Event Bubbling Works

When an event occurs, it first triggers on the target element (the element that was directly interacted with). After the event handler on the target element has executed, the event then bubbles up through the DOM hierarchy, triggering event handlers on ancestor elements in the process.

**Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of event bubbling:**

1. Event Trigger: An event occurs on a target element (e.g., a button click).

2. Target Phase: The event is handled by the target element’s event handlers.

3. Bubbling Phase: The event then propagates upwards through the parent elements of the target element, triggering event handlers on each ancestor in turn, until it reaches the top of the DOM tree or until it is stopped.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Event Bubbling Example</title>
    <style>
      .container {
        padding: 20px;
        background-color: lightblue;
      }
      .inner {
        padding: 20px;
        background-color: lightcoral;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="inner">
        <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
      </div>
    </div>

    <script>
      const container = document.querySelector(".container");
      const inner = document.querySelector(".inner");
      const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

      container.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log("Container clicked");
      });

      inner.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log("Inner clicked");
      });

      button.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log("Button clicked");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 2. Controlling Event Bubbling

#### 2.1 Stopping Bubbling:

Use the `stopPropagation()` method to prevent the event from propagating further up the DOM tree.

```js
// change the above code to this

button.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log("Button clicked");
  event.stopPropagation(); // Stops the event from bubbling up
});
```

With `stopPropagation()`, only the "Button clicked" message will appear in the console, and the other handlers on .inner and .container will not be triggered.

#### 2.2 Using Capture Phase:

Events can also be captured during the capturing phase, which occurs before the bubbling phase. This is less commonly used but can be enabled by setting the capture parameter to `true` in `addEventListener`.

```js
container.addEventListener(
  "click",
  () => {
    console.log("Container (capturing phase) clicked");
  },
  true
); // true enables capture phase
```

The event will first trigger the capturing phase on the container before reaching the button's event handler.

## Event Capturing

Event capturing, also known as event capturing phase or capturing phase, is one of the phases in the event propagation process in JavaScript. It occurs before the bubbling phase. In event capturing, the event starts from the outermost element and propagates inward to the target element where the event was originally triggered.

### 1. How Event Capturing Works

1. **Event Trigger:** An event occurs on the target element (the element that directly received the event).

2. **Capturing Phase:** The event propagates from the outermost element (the document or a parent element) down through the DOM tree to the target element.

3. **Target Phase:** The event reaches the target element and is handled by the event handler assigned to it.

4. **Bubbling Phase:** The event then bubbles back up through the DOM tree to the outermost element.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Event Capturing Example</title>
    <style>
      .outer {
        padding: 20px;
        background-color: lightblue;
      }
      .inner {
        padding: 20px;
        background-color: lightcoral;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="outer">
      <div class="inner">
        <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
      </div>
    </div>

    <script>
      const outer = document.querySelector(".outer");
      const inner = document.querySelector(".inner");
      const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

      outer.addEventListener(
        "click",
        () => {
          console.log("Outer element clicked (capturing phase)");
        },
        true
      ); // true enables capturing phase

      inner.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log("Inner element clicked");
      });

      button.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log("Button clicked");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 2. Controlling Event Capturing

#### 2.1 Enable Capturing

When you add an event listener, you can specify whether it should be handled during the capturing phase by setting the capture parameter to `true` in `addEventListener`.

```js
document.querySelector(".outer").addEventListener(
  "click",
  () => {
    console.log("Outer element clicked (capturing phase)");
  },
  true
); // true enables capturing phase
```

#### 2.2 Disable Capturing

If `true` is omitted or set to `false`, the event will be handled during the bubbling phase (which is the default behavior).

```js
document.querySelector(".inner").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Inner element clicked (bubbling phase)");
});
```

#### 2.3 Use Cases for Event Capturing

##### 2.3.1 Handling Events on Parent Elements

When you need to capture events before they reach specific child elements, event capturing allows you to execute code early in the event propagation process.

##### 2.3.2 Implementing Custom Behavior

Event capturing can be used to implement custom behaviors such as logging or manipulating events before they reach the intended target elements.

## Event delegation

Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript for handling events more efficiently by taking advantage of event bubbling. Instead of attaching event listeners to multiple child elements individually, you attach a single event listener to a parent element. This approach leverages the fact that events bubble up through the DOM, allowing you to handle events for multiple child elements through their common ancestor.

### 1. Why Use Event Delegation?

#### 1.1 Performance

Reduces the number of event listeners attached to individual elements, which can improve performance, especially when dealing with a large number of elements.

#### 1.2 Dynamic Content

Simplifies the handling of events for elements added to the DOM dynamically after the initial page load. Instead of adding listeners to each new element, you only need to handle events at the parent level.

#### 1.3 Code Maintainability

Makes your code easier to maintain by consolidating event handling logic in one place rather than having it scattered across multiple elements.

### 2. How Event Delegation Works

1. **Attach Listener to Parent:** Attach a single event listener to a parent element that will handle events for all its child elements.

2. **Use Event Targeting:** Inside the event handler, determine which child element triggered the event using the event.target property.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Event Delegation Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul id="itemList">
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>

    <script>
      // Select the parent element
      const itemList = document.getElementById("itemList");

      // Attach a single event listener to the parent element
      itemList.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
        // Check if the event target is an 'li' element
        if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
          alert(`You clicked on ${event.target.textContent}`);
        }
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 3. Advanced Use Cases

#### 3.1 Handling Dynamic Elements

Event delegation is particularly useful for handling events on elements that are dynamically added to the DOM after the page has loaded.

#### 3.2 Event Filtering

You can use event delegation to handle different types of child elements or filter based on attributes or classes.

```js
// Example with class-based filtering
itemList.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  if (event.target.classList.contains("special-item")) {
    console.log(`Special item clicked: ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});
```

#### 3.3 Multiple Event Types

You can use delegation to handle multiple event types on child elements

```js
temList.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log(`Item clicked: ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});

itemList.addEventListener("mouseover", function (event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log(`Mouse over item: ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});
```

### 4. Summary

Event delegation is a powerful technique for managing events in JavaScript, especially when dealing with dynamic content and improving performance by reducing the number of event listeners. By attaching a single event listener to a parent element and using event properties to determine which child element triggered the event, you can efficiently handle events for multiple child elements.

## Event Simulation

Event simulation in JavaScript involves artificially triggering events on DOM elements to mimic real-world user interactions. This technique is invaluable for testing, automation, and creating dynamic user experiences.

### 1. How it Works

#### 1.1 Create an Event Object:

- Use the Event constructor to create an event instance.
- Specify the event type (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover', 'input').
- Optionally, provide additional details like bubbles, cancelable, and custom data.

#### 1.2 Dispatch the Event:

- Call the dispatchEvent method on the target element to trigger the event.

```js
const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

// Create a click event
const clickEvent = new Event("click");

// Simulate a click
button.dispatchEvent(clickEvent);

// Simulate a reload
dispatchEvent(new Event("load"));
```

By mastering event simulation, you can create more robust, interactive, and testable web applications.
